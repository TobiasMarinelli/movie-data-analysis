# 🎬 Movie Data Analysis

This is my first data analysis project using Python, as part of my learning journey in data analytics.

The goal of this project is to explore a dataset of movies and uncover interesting insights about genres, ratings, revenues, and runtimes.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Identify the most common movie genres
- Analyze the relationship between budget and revenue
- Find the top-rated and highest-grossing movies
- Calculate the average runtime of successful films

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Files in this repo

- `movie_data_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with data cleaning, analysis, and visualizations.
- (Optional) `data/tmdb-movies.csv`: Dataset from [Kaggle - TMDB Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata)

## 📈 Sample Visualizations

- Top 10 movie genres (bar chart)
- Budget vs Revenue (scatter plot)
- Top rated movies (table)
- Average runtime of successful films

---

## 🧠 Conclusions

- Drama, Comedy, and Action are the most common genres
- Higher budgets often lead to higher revenues
- Top-rated movies don't always match the highest-grossing ones
- Successful films tend to run around 110–120 minutes
